My name is Taeho Nam. I have both a BS and a MS degree in computer science from Kwangwoon University in Korea. During my BS degree, I was interested in hardware design and testing with Verilog/Quartus/Modelsim and Operating System architecture. Also, during my master's degree, I mainly studied firmware design of NAND Flash controller and caching methods for improving web browser performance. I'm still working in computer science.

Nowadays, I'm especially interested in security, graphics and the Web that seem to be irrelevant. In this regard, I am interested in open source such as Chromium, Chromium OS and Wayland and trying to contribute to Chromium and W3C specifications by taking advantage of the spare time. The main computer languages ​​used are C, C++, and Python.
